- link: [Web Dev Cody - Video](https://youtu.be/lNaW4zlo8ZY)

I have put the exercises in a separate folder for each problem. Each folder contains a `README.md` file with the problem statement and a `solution.js` file with the solution.

## Problems
- [01 - Level Order Traversal: Print Each Level on a Separate Line in Binary Tree](01-level-order-traversal-print-each-level-on-a-separate-line-in-binary-tree/README.md)

## Copyrigth
All the problems and solutions are from [Web Dev Cody](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevCody), if not stated otherwise. I have just put them in a separate repository for my own reference.

## Author of the repository
