# GFG 160 - 160 Days of Problem Solving

This is a collection of problems from [GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of Problem Solving](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems). I have chosen to do it in JavaScript. I also have put the exercises in a separate folder for each problem. Each folder contains a `README.md` file with the problem statement and a `solution.js` file with the solution.

## Problems

- [01 - Second Largest](02-gfg-160/001-problem/README.md)
- [02 - Move All Zeroes to End](02-gfg-160/002-problem/README.md)
- [03 - Reverse an Array](02-gfg-160/003-problem/README.md)
- [04 - Rotate Array](02-gfg-160/004-problem/README.md)
- [05 - Next Permutation](02-gfg-160/005-problem/README.md)

## Copyright

All the problems are from [GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of Problem Solving](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems), if not stated otherwise. I have just put them in a separate repository for my own reference with my solutions.
